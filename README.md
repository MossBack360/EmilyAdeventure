# SYSTEM:STABILITY

> An AI-driven psychological horror sandbox about maintenance, cognition, and the quiet violence of trying to stay functional.

---

## Overview

**SYSTEM:STABILITY** is an experimental, AI-driven psychological horror game built around the metaphor of *maintenance*.
The player repeatedly organizes abstract sand-tray environments under systemic pressure — balancing order, disruption, and artificial stabilization.

This is not a medical simulation.
It is a narrative and mechanical exploration of:

* cognitive overload
* emotional regulation
* institutional systems
* the cost of “staying functional”

The experience blends slow procedural gameplay with AI-generated system responses to create a world that reacts to the player’s behavior — not with diagnosis, but with escalating instability.

---

## Core Concept

The player works inside a fictional system tasked with maintaining “stability”.

Each day consists of:

* organizing symbolic sand-tray objects
* managing limited cognitive capacity
* responding to interruptions and anomalies
* choosing whether to rely on stabilization buffs

These actions feed into an AI narrative layer that generates systemic feedback, environmental degradation, and bureaucratic reports.

The tension emerges not from combat, but from:

> repetition → pressure → compromise → adaptation

---

## AI-Driven System Layer

The game uses an AI backend as a **fictional institutional narrator**, not a psychological evaluator.

The AI:

* analyzes abstract spatial arrangements
* produces cold procedural reports
* modifies environmental rules
* escalates systemic instability

It never diagnoses the player.
It only destabilizes the fictional world.

This creates an evolving narrative feedback loop where mechanical decisions influence atmosphere, interface behavior, and perceived system reliability.

---

## Visual Direction

The interface aesthetic combines:

* Windows Classic UI language
* early-digital system metaphors
* dadaist collage textures
* pixel distortion and glitch artifacts

The visual design intentionally evokes outdated operating systems and corrupted utilities — reinforcing themes of maintenance, decay, and artificial stability.

---

## Gameplay Influences

The project draws inspiration from:

* systemic pressure mechanics
* ritualistic repetition gameplay
* psychological interface horror

Particular tonal inspiration comes from works exploring dependency, routine, and emotional exhaustion — interpreted through sandbox interaction rather than narrative linearity.

---

## Design Philosophy

SYSTEM:STABILITY is built around a simple premise:

> functioning is labor.

The game is designed to feel:

* repetitive
* constrained
* quietly stressful
* occasionally relieving

Buff systems provide temporary ease at long-term cost.
System feedback becomes increasingly abstract and unreliable.
The interface itself participates in the horror.

The goal is not victory — but endurance.

---

## Technical Direction

* Web-based sandbox architecture
* canvas-driven object interaction
* local state simulation
* AI narrative backend
* procedural UI degradation

The project is intentionally modular to support experimentation in AI-assisted narrative systems and interface-driven horror.

---

## Project Status

Personal experimental project.
Active exploration of:

* AI narrative systems
* psychological interface design
* procedural tension mechanics

Expect instability, iteration, and strange behavior.
