#  Sandbox Psychological Horror (WIP)

> A sandbox-style psychological horror experiment built with **PIXI.js**, featuring AI-driven behavior and emergent narrative elements.

 **Work in Progress** — this is currently a personal experimental project focused on exploring atmosphere, perception, and player psychology rather than a finished game.

---

##  Project Overview

This project is a sandbox psychological horror prototype designed to explore:

* unsettling environmental storytelling
* player perception manipulation
* emergent events
* AI-driven world reactions

Instead of scripted horror sequences, the goal is to create a **living sandbox** where tension builds naturally through interaction, ambiguity, and unpredictable behavior.

Think less jump-scare horror, more slow psychological pressure.

---

##  Core Ideas

### Sandbox Horror

The world is interactive and systemic rather than linear. Objects, physics, and environmental triggers combine to produce unexpected situations.

### Psychological Layer

Visual distortions, subtle inconsistencies, and perception tricks are used to create discomfort rather than direct threats.

### AI-driven Behavior (Experimental)

Certain systems react dynamically to player actions, allowing:

* adaptive pacing
* emergent encounters
* non-scripted tension

This is an ongoing area of experimentation.

---

##  Tech Stack

* **Rendering:** PIXI.js
* **Physics:** (planned / experimental integration)
* **AI Systems:** custom logic prototypes
* **Language:** JavaScript

The focus is rapid iteration and experimentation rather than production architecture.

---

##  Current Features (Prototype State)

* PIXI-based rendering sandbox
* interactive objects
* basic environmental logic
* experimental event triggers

More systems are being added as the project evolves.

---

##  Roadmap (Loose / Experimental)

* [ ] emergent AI encounter system
* [ ] perception distortion effects
* [ ] environmental storytelling mechanics
* [ ] sandbox object interactions
* [ ] sound-driven psychological cues
* [ ] save/load world state

Roadmap is intentionally flexible — this project evolves based on experimentation.

---

##  Philosophy

This is not meant to be a traditional horror game.

The goal is to experiment with:

* discomfort instead of fear
* ambiguity instead of clarity
* atmosphere over narrative

The sandbox structure allows unexpected psychological moments to emerge naturally.

---

##  Running the Project

```bash
# clone repository
git clone <repo-url>

# open index.html in browser
```

(Development workflow may change as tooling is added.)

---

##  Contribution

This is primarily a personal experimental playground, but ideas and discussions are welcome.

---

##  Status

Active personal exploration project. Expect rapid changes, unfinished systems, and broken experiments.

---

##  License

TBD — currently experimental personal project.

---

##  Notes

This project exists to explore how interactive systems can create psychological tension without relying on scripted horror conventions.

If something feels wrong… it’s probably intentional.
